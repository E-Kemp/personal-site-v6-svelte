This needs no introduction, I said in my last post something around the lines that this won't only be work talk! This is definitely one of those posts, because I was recently in a musical theatre pit band, and it was one of the best experiences I've had.

## The show

The show was called Spotlights, an LGBTQ+ coming of age story centered around a girl going a lot of self discovery while attending drama school. The cast were great, the writing was on point for a new show (this is the first time it was performed), and the music? The music was excellent. I've not been a part of or seen many musicals, but the music indeed felt very 'musical-ly', with lots of exiting choreographed numbers, slower emotional pieces and of course a kick-line dance! I can hear some inspiration from Into The Woods, it feels almost like an homage to musical theatre - and an introduction from the creative team to show what they have to offer. My only criticism is I want more! There were many plot lines that were tied up in one monologue, whereas many of these could have been resolved separately using extra numbers... But what do I know, I'm not a writer!

## Many firsts

I've played in many groups throughout my amateur musical career: brass band, concert band, big band, orchestra; but never a pit band. I got to play Trumpet and Flügelhorn in this musical, an opportunity that I would've been a fool to turn down! I've spent most of my life playing lower brass instruments in brass and concert band such as Baritone Horn, Euphonium and Tenor Horn; but I'm growing tired of them, I want to play more jazz and funk - which these aren't used in. I could pick up a Trombone, but I can't read the music and the slide is weird, so playing a Trumpet just points me in a better direction - plus it means I can chop and change with Cornet and Flügelhorn.

## The people

Playing with such a high caliber of musicians was an absolute pleasure, and I can only hope this experience opens up more opportunities to play with similar groups in the future. Some of these players are friends for life, some are a blast from the past when I played with UEA Music Society, some were new faces! The people really made this ensemble something special, when I first saw the names I knew this would be a great group of people. Rehearsals were full of laughs and magical music making, and that's all I want from a group of musicians.

## Post show high

So the show was an amazing experience, I really hope this is something that happens again soon enough. I've been riding the high of this show all week, if I get to do this again I'll never take it for granted. Playing in a band for an audience is great and all, but playing for such a talented cast with a group of stellar musicians is even more rewarding. The music making is different, the feeling is different - more intense, something I've never felt before.
