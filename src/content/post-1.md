## Introduction

Welcome! This blog will mostly be about my professional development, where I detail what I've been learning and highlighting any personal projects or specific contributions to [eLife Sciences](https://github.com/elifesciences) that I'm particularly proud of.

eLife Sciences? Yes, I'm an Open Source Developer for an open access health sciences journal, with the aim of chaning how research is published so we can improve the culture of research - a cause that sits close to my heart! We're driving change in research by championing a PRC (publish, review, curate) model that publishes an article upon it's initial peer review and assessment from eLife. You can see an see more of our new model [here](https://elifesciences.org/peer-review-process). As the job title suggests, our work is open source, so my work is fully available to peers to setup and run locally. Specific repositories I am and will be involved in are:

- [Enhanced Preprints Client](https://github.com/elifesciences/enhanced-preprints-client)
- [Enhanced Preprints Server](https://github.com/elifesciences/enhanced-preprints-server)
- [Enhanced Preprints Import](https://github.com/elifesciences/enhanced-preprints-import)

## What else is there here?

This blog won't **only** be about my software successes, there may also be installments detailing developments in other hobbies, such as climbing or my musical career! I'm excited to see where I can take this website and any future content, see you in the next post!
